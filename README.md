The idea with this is going to 3 pronged. First I want to get a few sorting 
algorithms going. This shouldn't be too bad, easy peasy. 
Next I'm going to add sound to this, so in real time I can hear which number 
is being sorted. Of course I may have to delay the sorting so that all the sounds
don't all play at once.
Thirdly, and the most of it is going to be adding visualization, drawing what 
the computer is doing.
