## Description
This program does 3 different sorting algorithms, and draws the current state of the array of random numbers at every step.

The sorting algorithms are:
- Insertion Sort
- Bubble Sort 
- Quick Sort 

Note: Timing is not incredibly accurate as it takes into account every drawing.

## Usage
