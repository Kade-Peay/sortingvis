The idea with this is going to 3 pronged. First I want to get a few sorting
algorithms going. This shouldn't be too bad, easy peasy.
Next I'm going to add sound to this, so in real time I can hear which number
is being sorted. Of course I may have to delay the sorting so that all the soundsdon't all play at once.
Thirdly, and the most of it is going to be adding visualization, drawing what
the computer is doing.

update: I totally changed direction. I switched from doing sound at all to jumping straight into visualizing it. I guess I can add sound but
right now I'm focused more on performance improvements and making the visualization more interesting. My next few things is I'd like to change the color of the currently selected num in the list. And I'd like to be able to visualize quick sort, but as it's recursive I've had a hard time knowing when to update and draw the array.
